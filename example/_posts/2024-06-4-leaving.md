description: A series of explanations and events

We left the city today, though things got hairy rather fast.

The moles we saw at the surface ended up being our way out. It turns out the lightless use them as mounted creatures, similar to my old Axebeak. We met with a grizzled man on the edge of the city who lent us a creature to ride to the surface, but we never got the luxury.

Instead, we found a fight. The troll and her underlings from our first night in this land reappeared in the tunnels near the city, looking for blood. In retrospect, I know now that enticing the troll a few days back to investigate the mole hills instead of the latrine perhaps only bought us time, rather than shaping into a proper solution.
