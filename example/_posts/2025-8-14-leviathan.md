title: Leviathan
description: A series of explanations and events
---

I spent the early hours of night deep in the notes I'd taken. I was hoping to get some use out of them, but I still cannot make heads or tails of them without Tazaam's knowledge.

Grem joined me for watch late into the night, and the two of us made note that the waves had gotten choppy. The mast of the ship was creaking, so we decided to wake Luisa on the off chance it broke.

Luisa, however, was far more concerned about the storm that was encroaching. She directed us in preparing the ship against the storm, but we quickly came to the realization that whatever was approaching was magical in nature. Noggin and Grem scouted ahead to find the eye of the storm, and… without much other option, we decided to sail through it and weather it out.

Grem had suspected that perhaps a thunderbird was involved with the storm, but noted they're typically benevolent in nature. Whatever was coming at us was filled with the same sort of power, but a "different type of hunger".

The ride through the storm went poorly, but not as bad as it could have gone. We were rattled when we reached the epicenter of the storm, and went about repairing the ship. Noggin, however, noted that the sun had risen, despite it being too early in the morn for such a thing. Its heat seared the ship so badly that the timbers themselves began to char, and just before we could investigate further, we were plunged into darkness once more.

The creature that then emerged before our ship could be described as nothing short of a leviathan: a serpent-like creature, finned and frilled, with a mouth large enough to swallow our ship whole. The leviathan spiked down our ship with scythe-like appendages, holding us steady, and produced a stalk with the sun-like bulb on the end.

Luisa was able to fend off the creature, while the rest of us scrambled. Evading the creature's attacks was surprisingly easy, given its lack of eyesight. We took no chances with the beast's main body. While Luisa crushed the scythes of the beast, Noggin kept its body from charging up and blasting us with its strange cutting ray. Had a single ray fallen on our ship, we likely would have lost the vessel immediately.

However, Luisa was our only true line of defense against the creature. Once it figured that out, it retreated and targetted her directly, swimming beneath the ship then launching itself aboard to gobble up Luisa mid-flight. Luisa was able to hold her own for a few seconds, but the rest of us were powerless to help as she took the brunt of the leviathan's ray.

The beast vanished afterwards, and reappeared with hopes to cut our vessel in twain from a safe distance away. We prepared ourselves to abandon ship, but… before the leviathan's ray touched our boat, it dissipated entirely. The beast's corpse rose to the surface, slain through some unknown means by an unconscious Luisa, who floated up shortly after.

We were able to retrieve Luisa and repair the ship to the extent that it would be able to sail. Her wounds seemed minimal, save for the scythe marks from combat, but she remained warm to the touch. She clutched a strange, obsidian shard between her hands which I attempted to identify. The result was… unfortunate.

I could not feel the blade of the obsidian shard, and I sliced off my fingertip while attempting to assess the object. Despite the clean cut, I could still… feel… my fingertip. I retrieved the appendage and attempted to reattach it, and it immediately readhered to the wound without further fanfare. Whatever this shard is, it appears to cut through physical objects easily, but fail to sever the metaphysical bonds between the severed pieces. I don't care to assess it further, but as Luisa says… "it'd make for a cool new weapon".

When she awoke near morn, we also discovered that her scales appear to be super-heated through no power known to either of us. She tested out this ability by plunging a hand into a bucket of water, and watched as the water evaporated. She reported feeling ill, but had no intent to discuss things with me further. By late morning, however, she was well enough to stand and move about without much issue.

Her own perspective on the creature's demise is… interesting. We did not see her fall into the water, and Luisa suspects that she fell into the gullet of the beast, but that it was unlike what we would expect out of such a creature. She retrieved a diseased looking fish from where she had gone, and insisted we cook it, but after hearing her description of the place I'm wary at best of eating anything from the creature's stomach. Interestingly enough, Luisa also is unsure of how exactly the creature was slain, although the cutting ability of her shard and the cutting ray of the beast seem to be linked in some way.

Before we sailed on, Grem was able to retrieve some supplies that had floated up from the leviathan's gullet. We found the top half of the cursed ship we had seen back in Last Gasp, from which Grem and her familiars were able to retrieve some basic supplies (the lack of anything on the interior of our own vessel has led us to christen it the "Male Living Space". We hope to remedy that with at least a few barrels and some rope). She appeared to be looking ill after boarding the vessel, and did not appear to be looking fresh for a majority of the day.

We also found a half-digested thunderbird in the stomach of the leviathan, lending credence to Grem's initial guess regarding the storm's origin.

Luisa admonished us for staying back in the midst of combat with the creature, and I can't help but admit guilt in that aspect. She acknowledged that our fault was not in pure cowardice, but rather in an inability to help from a physical standpoint. Grem and Noggin are grand magicians, but I've seen neither draw a blade, so I suspect that they have little physique to lend to one.

As for myself… it has been a few years now since I've served. My test for entering the army was more about me being disease-free and able-bodied than it was about any sort of strength I might have. Jakob never demanded any further exercise from me, and if Ross had expected more out of us he never brought it up. We seldom ventured outside of the clinic, [parts here have been erased] I didn't get too much exercise on the daily as the result.

So, we agreed to training under Luisa in the evenings (Noggin withstanding).

The rest of the voyage was thankfully uneventful, and we made land before nightfall. I believe this is our destination: a vast, volcanic island bereft of life (though, we've both seen lights on the horizon and footprints on the shore, so perhaps the place is inhabited). We spent a bit of time exploring, and came across hellhound tracks rather than a shelter, so we've decided to stay together and sleep within one of Noggin's magical structures within the ship.

I've elected to stay up top on the ship for the night, continuing to work through these notes of mine. It's maddening to not be able to understand these things further without Tazaam's interference.

Though, training with Luisa today has also exposed a new frustration with my own strength. I've been travelling now for… 

Ah, I regret now not keeping a journal earlier. I'm not sure how long it's been since I left my world behind. More than a year, I'm certain of that. Maybe two?

I had hoped by now I would be a stronger person than I am now.

My magic is laughable by Noggin's standards. I cannot conjure a simple wizard's trick, and he refuses to teach me anything of his power. It feels shameful to have begged for so many scraps of knowledge from so many magicians, and to have only this paltry healing at my disposal. I should be grateful that I have learned any magic at all, but… this all feels too little too late. I am learning at far too slow of a curve: the dunce stringing together vowels in hopes of forming an ill-fitting word.

And Luisa has shown me that I am not fit to wield a blade either. I cannot imagine myself charging a leviathan the way she did, and the simple exercises she has put me through have left my body sore and unusable. I don't even have the mana left to heal my own aching body. How long would it take to learn how to really weild a knife properly, and to steel myself to use it? I had imagined it would be easier than learning magic, but… if I have set to bar so low on that front, it must be through the ground here.

[several lines here have been written and erased]

Katherine, if you come across this journal, I hope you find this all amusing rather than pitiful. I never professed to being more than the man I was with you. But, I am trying to be more now.

I may flounder my way through this world of yours, but I hope to find my legs yet.
