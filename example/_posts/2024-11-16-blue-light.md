title: Blue Light
description: A series of explanations and events

We were ambushed in the early hours of morning.

Two strange, shimmering bio-mechs attempted to sneak up on us in the night. We weren't caught unawares, though. Our watch noticed them and warned us to keep quiet, and take to the treetops. We assisted the refugees in making it to safety, and went to face the creatures ourselves.

These mechs were much stranger than those we had run into yesterday. If the creatures we encountered yesterday were oxen, these were wolves. They were sleek, and faster than anything I had seen before, organic or machine.

The dwarf Dedrik moved to face them on his own, and while the machines pounced on him immediately, they did not harm him. When I attempted to approach, however, they were quick to threaten me.

However, before they could slit my throat, a blue light appeared on my chest. It was much like the one that I can see for myself, though different in color and clearly visible to all who looked. The machines quelled down at once, eager to obey the commands of one possessing a blue light. We sent them away to where they had come from.

It was bothâ€¦. reassuring and terrifying. On the one hand, it was good to know that these creatures responded to those with blue lights. We have a handful in our squad, and among the refugees, so reprogramming the creatures again should be trivial.

However, I find it difficult to believe that all their mechanizations adhere to such simple security measures. Surely we have given away a secret we did not know we had. And, quite simply but, these bio-mechs had us completely at their mercy. Should they have decided to strike, I would have been dead on the spot, and I doubt the others would have fared too much better. I cannot help but think that things will get significantly worse from here.

I will count my blessings though, and happily report the remainder of the day was quiet, if exhausting. We made good headway towards the church, and are expected to arrive tomorrow night. Let us hope for a quiet end to this escort.
