We've taken shelter in a monastery for the night. I can't tell how far we are along our journey, but we've certainly passed the peak.

The journey up was uneventful, for better and for worse. We have not encountered any Yetis, but neither have we encountered much danger.

The cold is biting, but we were well prepared and have found good shelter for the night. We found an abandoned, golden monastery high in the mountains. It has shown no signs of life within, save for a mummified corpse praying at the altar of the innermost sanctum, which we left well-alone.

It's proven to be an interesting location. Deeply religious place, and with roots in what we believe to be both the people of red light and blue light. Like the first hold we found, this place shows ancestry of orcish origin, and nearly all text within was written in an old style of orc

My orc is passable, though I'm much better with written than spoken. It was the second language I ever learned. When I had first left my world, I ran into a group of orcs patrolling the highlands where I had landed (the little coastal town of Minnow, which I highly recommend visiting for any who find it). They were kind enough to not kill me on sight, and to excuse my poor Common and worse understanding of how things worked in their world.

In hindsight, I was treated like a laughingstock most of the time I lived in that city. I hardly noticed it at the time though. I was grateful for the kindness of the townspeople, as they invited in a stranger with no gold to his name and no understanding of the world around him. I was ill the first several days I had arrived, acclimating to new biomes and diseases, and they helped me through it all.

The orcs were especially kind, offering me lodging and idle work as I began to reclaim myself. I learned orcish under the company of dottir Oghash. I taught her basic medical training, and she taught me to speak their tongue. More importantly, she found me training materials to read against, which helped more than her lessons did.

When she ran out of books, I left Minnow behind. By then, I had come to my sense enough to realize that I was not a welcome guest, but rather a pet of the townsfolk. I can't hold resentment against them, of course, for they did open their homes and their lives to me. However, I have no desire to return and be known by them once more.

Regardless, all that to say that my orcish is surprisingly good, and practiced. I was able to cross reference a dictionary for the old version of the orc language, which helped fill in the gaps I came across. I've got a copy of the dictionary in my pack now, in the form of a strange stone tablet. I'll leave instructions on its usage near the back of the journal.

We put together old maps, death records (confirming the existence and violence of Yetis in these parts), and star charts throughout the night, seeking to piece together more of the puzzle for why we were here and where exactly we were. Answers remain scarce, and nothing we found felt worth mentioning in particular detail, but I also took the atlas back with us for further study.

The monastery's religion also became known to us, while we studied an old child's folktale. Two sister gods, one stoic and one adventurous, are the main figures. The younger brother of the sisters had two familiars, with whom he plotted. It's a story of deceit and betrayl, and betraying the betrayer. An interesting orcish legend.

Thankfully, the gods of this monastery seem to take no mind in us staying here. We'll see if the night has anything in store for us, but otherwise it's nice to write and sleep somewhere warm.
