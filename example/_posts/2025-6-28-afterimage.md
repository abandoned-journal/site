description: A series of explanations and events

I had an odd dream last night.

I dreamt the red god was celebrating the death of Dagatar. It roamed around in the darkness, stirring itself into a chant. It grew from a whisper into a frenzy, decrying Dagatar as a tyrant, and burning me away under its sight.

Since I've awoken from that dream, I cannot recall the desire to ever return to sleep. Whatever compelled me in body and mind to rest, now feels foreign. I hope the sensation passes, but… even now as I write, I feel no fatigue from the day, nor any impulse to rest my limbs.

I suspect this is a blessing from the red god. In its strange ways, perhaps it sees this as a reward. I wonder if the others have had contact with their gods as well.

Luisa said nothing about the matter, but approached me last night and asked the write the last few entries in the journal. I can't read them myself, but she seemed distressed while writing them. I'm not sure if that was pertaining to their contents, or just the day as a whole.

She seemed the most distressed of everyone over Noggin's behaviour yesterday. I can't say I blame her. Noggin has saved the two of us on numerous occasions, and offered a sense of clarity into this strange world since we all arrived. To find something… strange, about him causes some unrest.

I talked with him about the matter this morning, and with his permission the larger group. Unfortunately, we seem to know about as much as Noggin does. Whatever power that slayed Dagatar is hosted within Noggin without his knowledge and control, and whatever it compels him to do seems without reason. Noggin suspected that something back at the monastery may have influenced him, though we know not what.

I've reviewed my notes on the monastery, and recall the oddity at finding the place abandoned. I remember the strangeness with the gods and legends depicted in that space. I fear whatever afflicts Noggin is tabboo among the locals, and we may need to use kid gloves when attempting to learn more about such matters.

I also learned how our blue light companions survived while the other champions of Dagatar did not: Halfdane interfered with things. Supposedly, Halfdane cut the lights out of their chests with his rapier, saving their lives. After hearing this, I attempted the same described action on a comatose civilian, with no effect. Once again, whatever patron Halfdane draws from is granting him some ability I cannot wrap my head around.

In the attempt though, I did discover that those comatose citizens of the city were held in statis. They were seemingly immune to hunger, thirst, even mortal injury. Whatever power is keeping them blank, is seemly preserving them for something else to come. It's concerning, perhaps, but I'm still overjoyed to find that these people may live to see another day.

As we were discussing these matters, as satyr found our doorstep, one of the few living people we've seen in the town since its downfall. She claimed to have been stuck working beneath the city in Dagatar's tunnels these past fifteen years, and only now venturing out into the daylight. She was frightened, and delusional, and unkempt. I escorted her to the edge of town, where the sight of the outside world seemed to comfort her.

In thanks, she offered me a strange artifact: a tear in reality. A simple piece of string, nearly six feet in length, capable of tearing a hole into another reality for a short time. It's an interesting object.

When I presented it to the group, Dedrik suggested we take it to traverse into his homeland, a dwarven settlement. I would not have been opposed to the matter, save for the lights still in our chest. I fear if we leave this game board, we may be killed. I fear also that should we leave, our lives are still subject to being snuffed out if another band of champions comes along and slays the usurper gods.

We've agreed to stay within this world for now, at least until everyone's lights are removed, should that be an option. It simply feels too dangerous to leave otherwise. Dedrik was shocked at finding such an item so easily though, and seemed to suggest it was rare beyond belief.

I believe otherwise, at this point. I've visited a handful of realities, and never had consistent means to move between them. I find that if you are looking for a means to walk across the fabric of reality, you will find it.

I think my first jump was the hardest. I knew practically nothing about magic when I was still on Earth. Finding a practitioner who wasn't immediately obvious as a fraud was a difficult task. I met with many strange people, and wasted my pittance savings on them, with no luck. I remember being very disheartened at the time, but looking back I suppose I wouldn't have been able to take that money with me anyways. What good is paper currency out here?

After a few months, though, I found an old woman who had me step through a mirror. I can't recall her name, I can't recall much else about her, and once I had stepped through I was somewhere else entirely with no fanfare and no means of going back. It was… thrilling, but also quite abrupt.

Since then, I've found people more easily. Most realities I've visited have magic as a staple study within the world, if not dimensional magics specifically. I can ask around without seeming crazy or idiotic.

Typically I'm sent down a wild goose chase of chaining together contacts, until I meet with someone capable of tearing open the seams between reality. Often times, they charge me a small amount and then send me on my way without much out of the ordinary.

I've had two strange encounters when it came to payment:

The first was with a young man who, rather than ask for payment, instead advertised his mystical mail service. I received a brochure from a small, glowing blue bird as I was sent on my way. I soon lost the brochure, as I had been sent to the midst of a thick swamp, which quickly swallowed me up to my neck.

The other was where I hitchhiked onto a boat with no sails, instead pulled by a pair of gigantic white dragons. The crew was lively, and bid me stay and dine with them after the trip between worlds was completed. I did not linger on that ship. To be quite frank, the crew treated me with nothing but enthusiasm and respect, but a deep fear gripped me whenever I was in their vicinity. Most of the crew were proper demons, but they were tame in comparison to the humans aboard the vessel.

Apart from those two instances, travel has been easy and uneventful.

I do admit, having my own artifact to instantiate the process is interesting. I remember [parts here have been completely erased]

I've seen magicians use artifacts to travel. But, I don’t know how much of it was the object itself, and how much was the magician's own magic. It looked like a normal set of keys to me.

In any case, I've taken the tear in reality and threaded it through a spare needle. It's tied up properly and stored among my things for now. I'm not sure when it'll come in handy, but it's nice to have a backup plan for getting out of here if things go poorly.

While we were leaving the city, we found many trolls and a strange woman congregating near the docks. The woman was of an unknown race to me, and explained that her kind would grow features of the things they consumed. We did not hold conversation for long, but she asked us for a donation in gold to treat the trolls. I was surprised to find that my donation was not, in fact, to help fund their mercenary work, but rather that the gold itself seemed to have a soothing effect on the trolls. I did not consider their idleness to be a disease, but it seems as though it truly is the case.

We took a few boats from the harbor for our travels, with plans to continue North. We didn't make it all too far before we found the underwater canals we were searching for, and vines blocking our route. We were able to find some tools nearby to help with the process, some flamethrowers that Dagatar's people had invented.

As night began to fall, I realized that I still had no desire to sleep or rest my eyes, and that my body had no fatigue from the day's events. Grem stayed up with me a while, but eventually needed to enter her trance. While I was helming the mole, a strange darkness crept over the ship, and I had to reawaken both Grem and Noggin to help me figure out what it was.

The darkness was some sort of shadow-beast, much like a panther. They were easily repelled with light and a bit of fire, but one managed to ravage our ranger's arm. The marks it left behind were necrotized, a nasty bit of magic I was not expecting from the creatures. I treated the wound as normal for now, but I do not like the idea of heading back through these tunnels and risking an attack again.

Now, as morning comes back around, I find that I'm still no wearier than I was last night. I suppose we'll see what today holds, and go from there.
