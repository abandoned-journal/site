We've run into some new companions, as well as a bit of a logistics nightmare.

Shortly after resurfacing by the river, we surveyed the path north, only to find it occupied. Three strange bio-mech amalgamations, much like the ones we had seen by Fever, took up most of the road. They were a transport group carrying imprisoned women, children, and prisoners, and clearly planning to do something inhumane to them all.

We planned to address the situation, but something strange happened before we were able to catch up to them: we were witness to the summoning of a new set of heroes, pulled directly from a sheer stone cliff.

Luisa, Noggin, and I do not recall being summoned in such a way, though without our memory of arriving there's little to be said for our own journey. I myself did not get a good look at the process, but I've gathered a sample of the affected rock which I'll be keeping labelled in my pack, and a streak from the sample will be displayed at the bottom of the last entry page from today.

These newcomers comprised of two elves (one of mixed descent), and a dwarf, disoriented but unharmed by the summoning. One of the elves appeared to be a magician, and the other a huntress who had been recently assisting the dwarf in a bear hunt. They thankfully shook off the confusion of the situation to help dispatch the strange creatures holding the people hostage.

I got a chance, during their initial scuffle, to try out the twinning effect on one of my more concrete spells. With three newcomers sporting minor wounds when I arrived on the scene, it seemed an apt time to attempt a cast of Healing Word twinned twice off the original spell.

I had been warned by a magician from Pearlwall that attempting to twin spells very rarely ever went well. The idea of taking magic, something that already on its own is volatile, and extrapolating it into a copy of itself in another space… well it can lead to complication. Especially if you are attempting a healing spell, and not a destruction one. Spells already are taxing on the mind, and attempting to focus on two distinct spells (albeit, with the same intent and script behind them), is begging for trouble.

However, it seems there are some spells that twin much easier than others. Healing Word was the first I ever saw performed, by a tired old nurse working at a hospital I was unfortunately admitted at. Despite her fatigue, she carried out the spell flawlessly, several times throughout the day. She kindly sat down to tea with me late into the night, and explained that many healing spells, with practice, could be twinned and cast en mass. Her recommendation was to never go above three castings at a time for Healing Word, and to keep things simple. She said, often times she only used it in two scenarios: when a group of people were lightly scraped, or when a group of people were on death's door.

And I think I understand now why those two situations work so well with this concept. In dire situations, you need only address severe wounds. There is no time for finesse in such situations, so a broad spell to stem bleeding works across multiple bodies without too much need to change things up.

Likewise, when you're simply addressing a few cuts and bruises across multiple people, you can more or less leave the spell on autopilot. Give it a few broad instructions, then weave the magic and send it en mass. Neither situation results in a clean heal, but neither requires it either.

In any case, I am happy to have tried that once, and I'm interested to try it again. When I'm feeling confident in this spell, I may try others en mass. Thankfully, I got no further practice in today, because Luisa was able to dispatch the enemies with little effort once she reached them.

The prisoners were unscathed, and in acceptable shape. Our own party was likewise unscathed, though the newcomer dwarf, Dedrik, had broken his hand jamming it into the machinery of the creatures. Given the other heavy machinery injuries I've seen, I count him lucky he didn't lose a finger altogether. I was able to see to his injury at once, though he proved uncooperative.

His companion, the huntress Iris was cheerful and much friendlier, and was clearly skilled in her work. They spoke to us, asking us to explain much of what we ourselves had been seeking to understand these past few days. Like us, they seemed discontent with the answers given.

I did get a chance to speak in depth with the magician though, Gremm, who kindly sold me a copy of the bestiary she had been putting together. I find many of the creatures in it surprisingly familiar, with similar legends to those from my own homeland. I'm curious if we come from a similar place, though… I had never met an elf in my life until I had ventured away from it.

All three seem like odd individuals, but capable ones. Given how much I've come to rely on Luisa and Noggin these past few days though, I suspect that a few more members to our little party will go a long ways. Not to mention, we are now responsible for the lives and livelihood of the band of refugees freed from the fight.

We pulled a few suspicious looking members from their ranks and found that there were a handful of prisoners who were a bit zealous on how they planned to treat the others upon their return. These prisoners appeared to be soldiers who had been court-martialed and tossed in with the others. Some were eager to regain their standings, and happy to turn over the others, so we sent them on their way. Others were far quieter… more content to keep their thoughts to themselves.

That mostly concluded that sending these people back to the Lightless City was unfeasible. The journey alone would be inconvenient without a good steed like the mole, and the city certainly did not have the supplies capacity to take care of themselves, let alone others. Adding to that the possibility of espionage from the refugees, and it was simply not going to fly.

Freedom would mean nothing for these people if they had no means to return home or start anew, and we weren't in the situation to provide any of that. Freeing them from their cages was a good first step, but none of us had the means to feed, clothe, or shelter the forty or so refugees who now looked to us for guidance. With our only known settlement already stricken from our possibilities, discussions quickly grew chaotic.

We talked options with the refugees for a while and eventually settled on plans to escort them to a nearby church. Despite having affiliation with Dagatar, the same god who our new enemies worshipped, the church was assured to us to be a capable safehaven. It would take a few days travel, but would take us through a woodland in the opposite direction of where those bio-mech creatures were being produced.

At that point, we were already fairly certain that our position was compromised, and possibly our plans as well. But, moving was better than staying still. We set to the road and escorted the refugees through the first leg of travel.

During our getaway, Gremm revealed herself to be a musician, as well as a magician, and played some soft tunes to quell the spirits of the refugees. Her playing also caught the eye of several weasel-like creatures who our huntress has taken a shine to.

She proved herself today in finding us not only a fine clearing to set up our camp, with space, shelter, and water to provide for us all; but also managed to find for us the same berries that the weasels fed upon. I cannot speak to its flavor, but can assure it's a step up from spider meat.

We have many mouths to feed though, and not nearly the supplies to see to them all. These refugees are weak and tired, and we are but a confused band of travelers seeing them on their way. Even as such, we're determined to see them to safety. And, having six sets of eyes for keeping watch is much more convenient than three.
