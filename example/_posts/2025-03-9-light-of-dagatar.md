description: A series of explanations and events

It's been a while since I've been able to write.

The good news: we encountered the yetis.

The bad news: it turned out to be a singular, very angry ape.

Gremm and Luisa were able to hold the creature's attention while Noggin and I set a trap for it, and thankfully we were able to scare it off without needing to kill it. It seemed to be scavenging for gold around the monastery, and wasn't inclined to stick around after a little dissuasion.

The creature itself didn't seem particularly harmful, though we also didn't give it much leeway to cause is harm. Oddly enough, it seemed to understand magic to some degree, or at least enough to understand how to not be fooled by it. In truth, however, I believe the only danger you may wish to look out for in the Yetis is the gas that emanates off of them once they've been hurt. It was able to corrode the golden trimmings above the doorframe, and anything that can corrode gold is… not a substance I can ever advise having near the skin.

Thankfully, we had no other exciting encounters beyond that. The rest of the journey down the mountain went smoothly.

Actually entering the city was another matter. The numerous guards asked us for our "orders" to enter the city, and we had no means of providing them. The order capsules we had received were in Noggin's belongings, and Noggin had self-selectively decided to hide himself away in the deer carcass sack for the trip into the city, for reasons beyond our understanding.

We were able to bluff our way past, but we couldn't go ten feet in the city without something requiring "orders' for us to do. Even staying in the local inns required "orders", not money. 

Noggin and I argued for a while on how to best deal with the situation, and eventually we wound up at one of the beaurocratic offices of Dagatoth, hoping to procure either legitimate or bribed orders from the people there within. Gremm hammed it up and managed to get us some shipping orders, which included access to some lodging and a boat, should we wish to grab one. Unfortunately, this means that Gremm is also legally registered within the city, which will likely have as many advantages as disadvantages. A blood record seems like a powerful thing, though I'm not quite sure how yet.

While my focus was mainly on just finding a place to sleep and permission to leave the city, Noggin was insistent on thinking to the future. Should prying eyes find this book, they should know we plan on carrying our orders to the full extent of Dagatar's will, or whatever the bloody name of the god of this place is.

And of course, we already have enemies within the city. The bastard Halfdane has shown his face again, bartering information with us once more. I had hoped the Oni had killed him back in the lightless down, but I knew that to be optimistic.

Gremm and Luisa were able to trade with him a while, getting us some of the information we needed to make it through the city and set future plans in motion (our very normal and excellent plans of carrying out the order to ship stone). While they conversed, I attempted to-

[more words are erased here, and written over]

-cast magic upon Halfdane, and was met with strong resistance. Strong, however, not instant deflection.

I traded him the tablet of folk tales from the mountain monastery for information on his ability to dispel magic. He claimed it was not an ability I would be able to learn, or at least not in the same way that he had. His power evidently comes from "friends in high places", though he would not share the names of any of his "employers". I would not be surprised it he works directly for a god, though I would not know which. Certainly not Dagatar.

I learned one other weakness through our interactions though, and it is not one I believe I would be willing to exploit, and certainly not transcribe. I simply mention it to say his mind and tongue may not be as tight as they initially seemed.

I loathe to admit that I was excited to encounter him again, and frustrated to not be able to learn anything of substance from our exchange. I feel as if I am only getting breadcrums from the man, when there's a veritable feast I could acquire if I had the means to ask for it.

I'm certain at this point that while the character is untrustworthy, we are pitifully outmatched against him at present. Should he have wished to take anything by force, I'm not convinced we could have stopped him.

I can hate him for that, and I will. But if-

[Several paragraphs have been written, and meticulously erased]

I can't think about this right now, I'm too angry. It's poor material for this journal anyhow, nothing relevant. Simply steer clear of Halfdane, should you encounter him.

The sooner we get out of this city, the better.
