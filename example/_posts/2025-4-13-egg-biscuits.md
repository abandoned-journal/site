description: A series of explanations and events
---

Things have gone well, for the time being. I'm cautious to recount the day's events in full, because we have yet to leave the city, and I do not mean for this to become a confession of crimes.

However, there is certainly plenty I can write about today. For starters, Dagatar's realm serves pisspoor breakfasts.

The food itself is fine, but we realized this morning that the orders we acquired yesterday were only for Grem. Since the rest of us lacked orders, we were given no food. Grem was also given a warm drink akin to coffee, but far sweeter and fruitier, like a juice. We shared sips of the drink, and it seemed to affect Noggin far more than the rest of us. I'd imagine due to their stature that gnomes may be more prone to caffeine than us taller folk. I wonder if it had any effect whatsoever on Luisa.

There was discussion about showing up to Grem's jobsite and actually working an honest day, but we would have had to leave the city and sleep overnight at another location, which felt like a step back. Instead, we moved forwards with a plan to potentially secure us supplies and free movement around the city.

I must keep details sparse since, at least for the moment, we are reaping the benefits of our endeavors. We are currently spending the night at a rather lavish hotel within the city, and debating whether or not to take off in the morning. While we aroused little suspicion, I do not like the idea of transcribing specifics of where we were and what we did.

What I WILL say, is that Dagatar's guards are incompetent when it comes to dealing with surprises. They lack the ability to adapt, and that is as much a boon as it is a bane when trying to get around them. This place runs fully on orders, and orders can't account for everything. If you need to get around a guard, just bring up a mundane surprise in your life and complain about your orders being unable to address it.

Now, this deals with the human part of Dagatar's realm rather handily. Unfortunately, there's bloody order-verifying mechanism on every goddamn door. If you don't have orders, you can't do anything. What a miserable existence these people live.

This made navigation stressful, but not impossible. Some of the inner mechanisms had lower security for basic orders, which let us do a few things in our favor. We were able to restock my medicines, and acquire morphine in bulk. Breakfast should be covered for the foreseeable future as well.

Noggin was able to get his credentials verified as well today, hence our extravagant lodgings. I have not asked how this came to be, and he has not inclined to share.

We're in a good spot. I've kept an eye on the situation where I could and no suspicion has been aroused yet. I think it's possible we might get out of here without our names being known, though I worry for Grem.

The only other thing I wished to record of the evening was of two other afflictions I heard being discussed by the guards earlier in the day: Light Venge and Scarlet Whisper Withdrawal. The latter had been discussed before, it seems as though Scarlet Whisper is a drug that likely comes from the East? I suspect the ogre we fought back in the Lightless City was a user, and I remember the effects of the drug being quick horrific. I can only imagine the withdrawl symptoms.

Light Venge was a new one though. It came about when discussing Grem's light (which was not Blue, and an object of interest to the guards because of that), and presumably refers to some affliction a god can cause against one bearing their light who rebels against them. It seems to be uncommon but not unheard of to do so. I'm not sure why someone does this, or what it all entails, but it seems to carry some amount of risk. The guards seemed to imply there's a way to manually change one's light to blue, but I'm unconvinced that it does not involve killing or severely maiming the host in some way.

I think that's all I feel safe enough to record for now. With luck, we leave the city soon, and my records can be cleaner. I'm pleased with our risk and reward for today, but hope we can get back on the road soon. This place unveils new horrors at every turn.

(Speaking of new horrors, I lied. I also wish to have it on record that Noggin revealed to us a purchase of his from Whizzlebob's: a box holding a very finite set of paperclips. He suggested illusioning us into paperclips, then removing some from the box and seeing if the box would pull us across security. When we questioned the sanity of such a thing, he proceeded to test it out on a cleaning robot, which promptly was killed and compressed into a paperclip shape. I've never seen something more horrific in my life)
