Oh, Dagatar, why couldnâ€™t you be what I thought? His beautiful perfection of order and work, a
life where your path is decided and your rewards are equal without unnecessary struggle is a
fiction made not even for his own convenience. I could only dream of such a reality that is the
one Dagatar attempted to create in vain. But the world is grotesque. He is grotesque. The
only reliable path is your own blade, completing your work, and exchanging coins for jobs well
done. Even then you need to choose your employers wisely, something I have no desire to
learn again. But I fear we have already not done this in this world, and anticipate our future
consequences. May our souls have mercy.
