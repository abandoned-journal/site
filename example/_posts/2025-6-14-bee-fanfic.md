The following excerpt is written in Draconic in barely legible cursive with the occasional egg biscuit crumbs on the pages. The paper is crumpled with the faint smell of deer meat from
being stashed in Luiza’s bag. The title is smeared with deer blood, but you can make out the
word “Truth” in it.

--------------------------------------------------

“Go to the center-most tower and present your orders. Dagataar will be waiting for you.”

Douglass mentally repeated the words of the orders to himself over and over again, unable to
process. The orders felt lighter than they should be in his palms, becoming slick with his
anxious perspiration as the Seat of Stability grew larger in the distance. Each step through the
concrete jungle toward the looming capital building felt more and more weighted, as if its
sheer presence were pushing him back. Why him? Why now? Surely there were more worthy
followers to bathe in the presence of God.

Average in most aspects of his life, before being brought to Phaneron Douglass worked for
his father’s contractor business. Lacking the finesse or knowledge of the other workers, he
prioritized hauling the lumber and other materials around while his father and the other
employees focused on the actual construction work. It paid little but it gave Douglass
something to do. The efficient Dagataarian society pinpointed where his skills lied as they do
for everyone, and his life in the city mirrored his life before to the point he barely recognized
the change.

Like most of his orders, his last ones before receiving the summons involved carrying
particularly heavy goods from the docks to their destination. These items were usually shaped
in such a way that more standard machinery or carts would struggle to carry it properly, at
least until a new mechanism came out for said item. The muscle, pack mule, cart. These were
all nicknames that Douglass was used to, some he liked more than others. In both worlds he
was rarely valued for traits beyond his physical prowess and specifically for his raw strength
and health; Douglass was not trained in physical combat. Average in most other aspects of
his life, he could not help but wonder if there was a mistake. Surely there was someone else
more competent to handle whatever task Dagataar expected out of him.

In this particular case, the orders had him carrying a large spider-esque mass of what he
could only describe as steel and glass cables. He had no idea what it did other than the fact it
had the label “OM-?” on it followed by a schematic Douglass was not trained to read; it didn’t
take a genius to assume the OM stood for Ocean Machine. Why were those within Bastille
Agalloch if they were machines meant for the ocean anyways? But he was not given orders to
think, he was ordered to haul. And haul he did, using his bare hands as the thick calluses
covering the entire palms worked just as well as gloves in terms of protection from sharp
edges.

When he finished the job and received the orders to visit Dagatar, Douglass made no attempt
to hide his shock. Jonas, a particularly nosy character noticing his discontent, pried and made
the joyous news known to the rest of the staff immediately. Dock workers were congratulating
him, but he felt nothing. Numbness seeped into his core, and he only began to feel once more
when the cold metal of the orders were placed back into his hand, a faint vibration from the
bee inside stirring his senses.

“I...get to meet Datagaar?” he finally sputtered out. “But, why?”
Jonas shrugged. “Who knows? We ain’t gods. You got it good!” he slapped him on the back.

“But it doesn’t make sense-”

“It ain’t our jobs to know why, but do,” Jonas said firmly, chewing on a sausage biscuit. “You
know that well. May Dagataar’s light shine upon you.”

Douglass had no argument with that. Surely his lack of knowledge would be something they
kept in mind, and his questioning may even put the job at risk. He nodded and attempted to
keep his head a clean slate, but as the tower came closer in sight the anxiety rooted itself
deep into his core.

Finally, the entrance came into view for the Seat of Stability, the same building he brought the
OM part earlier to. Why did they have me receive my next orders all the way from the dock if
they wanted me to return here?, Douglass suddenly thought, the absurdity of it hitting him
before he pushed it away. Do not think, it’s not your job. Dagataar is a god, who knows what
goes on in a deity’s head.

As he walked though the main entrance, Douglass was greeted by rows and rows of
employees in teller boxes. Seeing their attire made him feel immediately out of place with his
rugged clothes built for longevity rather than professionalism. He walked past them straight to
the gate guarded by the Giant and presented his orders. The giant mostly ignored him, but his
associate was practically groveling and babbling at Douglass so quickly that he became
uncomfortable. Something about how he should tell Dagataar about his excellent work?
Douglass never liked suck-ups so he nodded with zero intention of doing what he asked, and
followed him to the elevator.

The elevators were a blur. At one point he had to leave the elevator, only to enter another
one. Yet another pang of doubt hit him, a god focused purely on efficiency made a clearly
inefficient choice. But yet again he pushed it down, though not as successfully as the last
time. The second elevator ride he was completely alone, and no one was there to greet him
when the doors finally opened. Slowly, hesitantly, Douglass left the elevators and walked up
the stairs to what was surely the top level.

The penthouse was large, hexagonal, the color of midnight, and with a floor and ceiling that
seemed to stretch on for miles. with pods lining the walls. Columns of water adorned each
corner, and upon closer inspection the walls were covered with various hexagonal pockets
that Douglass had no clue the use of. In the center of the room was a brightly lit light blue,
almost white. curtain. Douglass could barely make the outline out of a hovering object. He
waited, but nothing happened.

Eventually he spoke out, breaking the silence. “My name’s Douglass. Your grace?”
As he took a step forward, the shape shot forward, pressure against the edge of the curtain.

“You,” it said.

Douglass stopped in his tracks, his second step hovering inches above the floor. He quickly
brought it back in line with his back foot, and waited. The object retreated from the curtain and
silence returned to the space.

After a few minutes, Douglass cleared his throat. “Uhm, are you my god Dagataar? Your,
highness?” he tried again. “I came at your summons. May Dagata-, uhh, your light shine upon
you?”

Quiet permeated the space as the echoes of his questions bounced along the walls. Sweat
trailed down his forehead and the drops joined at his chin before falling to the floor. This
perpetual state of unknown drowned him. He could not step forward or risk his god’s, or what
he assumed to be his god’s, wrath. He could not leave, for his orders were clear; the elevator
doors would likely not open without completing whatever his task may be. His stasis was set
in stone.

That was when Douglass noticed it. Forced with the inability to move, he instead observed.
And he observed peculiarities. For one, the shape of the being that he assumed to be
Dagatar was… shifting. Vibrating. As if it weren’t solid, but gaseous in nature behind the
curtain. He also could hear tell-tale signs of exertion. Grunting, gasps, quiet but given the lack
of background noise he could catch them. He also noticed that the object was ever so slightly
growing in size over time.

Patience at his limit, Douglass decided to move forward once more. “Sir Dagataar, I am going
to walk up now, is that alright?” Taking the silence as a yes, Douglass tentatively took a step
forward. No response. He released a breath he didn’t realize he was holding, and continued
onward. This time, there was no response, no shout from Dagataar scolding or applauding his
actions, just heavy breathing and the occasional groan.

Douglass reached the translucent drapes and hesitated once more. Who was he to breach
the barrier of his own accord? His job wasn’t to think, it was to move, carry, haul, follow
orders. He was once again overcome with the sense of being an imposter on holy ground. But
in absence of instruction he felt he had little choice. In an unfortunate case of free will he
pulled at the curtain, and they floated down with little resistance.

On the other side was the floating object that was previously obscured. An octagon, then a
decagon, followed by a pyramid. The shape was changing rapidly, never ceasing in its quest
to mimic all possible geometric forms. It vibrated slightly, particles crumbling off then falling
back into line whenever a new shape was formed. It looked almost identical to Dagataar’s
picture on the public org chart. On closer inspection, the mass was not solid at all, but a
swarm. Hundreds, perhaps even thousands of tiny mechanical insects all circling in hypnotic
patterns, following a rhythm not audible to anyone else. A more discerning eye would
recognize these mechanical insects as bee-like, and specifically identical to the ones that
were visible in the orders that a man like Douglass carried around every day of his life in this
city.

But none of this was what Douglass saw.

At the bottom of the ever-shifting horde was a writhing of pale pink flesh, broken up by
patches of black and pale yellow fuzz. Steel dividers were welded horizontally across the
abdomen, giving an insect-like appearance connecting the plump sections with clear
separations. Each section throbbed rhythmically to its heartbeat, pale blue light shining
through the thin skin. Dozens of moist limbs slapped the marble floor as the form writhed in
discomfort. Moaning could be heard, yet there was no mouth on what Douglass assumed was
the creature’s head. Or eyes, or any face for that matter, just smooth pale skin broken up by
four separate gaping holes. Nothing could be seen within these holes, just the pitch black
void. Lower still was where Douglass’ gaze was transfixed; below the abdomen and between
the writing of legs was a pulsing orifice, regularly secreting fluids along with new insect
creations which immediately flew up to join the swarm. The sheer regularity gave off the
appearance that a string of mechanical creatures connected from the sphincter to the above
cloud. Another cry from the flesh form, another few bees popped out, more amniotic fluid
pooled onto the floor.

“Your fear did not prevent you from coming forward,” the voice said once more, startling
Douglass. “Good.” Douglass could tell it was originating from the figure below, as the holes on
its face would take turns moving for each word, inhaling and exhaling.

Douglass stared up at the shape that resembled Dagataar for a moment, two, hoping for it to
speak. Then, reluctantly, he looked back to the floor. “I’m here for my orders,” Douglass finally
managed, keeping his face as neutral as possible.

The abomination Douglass assumed to be Dagataar seized in what Douglass was eventually
able to interpret as laughter. “Orders, of course,” it managed between heavy breaths, “that is
what drives us all now, after all.”

“My orders?” Douglass asked again. He could feel his toes within his shoes clenching.

“Eager to leave? No, we will delay your orders. Let us discuss for a moment.” Dagataar
motioned with one of its many limbs to a single rusted metal stool beside it.

Douglass walked over slowly, clenching his fists in an attempt to prevent shaking. He wiped
away projectile fluid droplets off the seat with his shoe as best as he could before sitting
down. His mind whirled in far too many directions for Douglass to consolidate the thought
threads into a reasonable coherent plan, but one thing was for certain: this was not what he
expected to see when meeting his deity. He wondered if he walked into the wrong room, then
exiled that thought as heresy. This must be how gods are and I’m too dense to understand it,

Douglass tried to convince himself, unsuccessfully.

“You doubt my identity.” It was not a question.

“I… I’d never… ”

“No need. This, too, is good. It is proof you will be up for the task. For I am not Dagataar.”
The relief that shot through Douglass’ veins was borderline euphoric. “Oh, then this is a
mistake,” Douglass said quickly, starting to rise, “I see above you that Dagataar-”

“Sit,” the thing commanded, and Douglass found himself back in his chair. It groaned, pushing
out five or six more bees, then panted, catching its breath. It took a moment before
continuing. “Tell me, what do you expect out of a god of order?”

“I don’t know, I don’t think about things like that.”

“Come now, there will be no punishment for your words. This is a simple friendly
conversation.”

Douglass doubted its words, and knew he was in too deep. He was once again paralyzed
between knowing this moment would not pass without his action, yet also knowing his actions
would be under heavy scrutiny.

“Fool. I will answer for you then, the answer is perfection. A god is expected to be perfect.”

“Oh, yeah, you’re right, it’s perfection.”

“Silence, you have contributed nothing so listen instead. Humanity expects perfection if it
should toil under a deity, so you must give it perfection. And what is more perfect than
euclidean geometry?”

The, now triangular prism, floated forward, directly in front of Douglass. It was close enough
for him to single out individual bees, their eyes, and the awareness they were all staring at
him. The group was a single being, all directed at his presence. “So then Dagataar is…”

“The shape you see before you is what most individuals fortunate enough to earn a visit to the
god know as Dagataar. His form is ever-shifting, and parts of himself are in every order made
to ensure he keeps watchful eyes over all and that order continues. It truly is perfection.” The
creature’s head, or what Douglass assumed was his head, leaned toward the swarm. “It is
truly a shame that it is not reality.”

The flesh pressed four of its hands into the side of its abdomen, and after doing so the blue
light within its abdomen dissipated. The floating shape immediately collapsed, bees frozen
mid-flight dropped to the ground like rain. The new bees birthed from the creature’s womb lay
still in the amniotic fluid pool. Douglass stared at the bees as the fluid started to cover them
entirely.

“The insects have no will of their own,” it explained. “While they are made at least partially of
flesh, their minds work more that of a machine. Without orders, like everyone else under the
blue light, they cease to know what to do. Quite like you sitting there twiddling your thumbs.”
The vaguely humanoid creature smacked a few of the bees around, demonstrating their
inability to respond.

“Dagataar takes orders?” Douglass asked incredulously, the absurdity of the situation
snapping him out of his fear. “I don’t see any miniature orders being handed to each individual
bee.”

It winced in pain, nodding. “We all do. Like I said, these insects work more like machines.
They can receive their orders directly through blue light itself. I am actively blocking my own
receiver to show this display.” The creature gasped and his hands left his side, and the blue
light returned to his abdomen. The bees shot back up into the air, albeit more drenched than
before.

“So then you order the bees. Then that makes you Dagataar?”

“The bees take orders through me, but I take orders from others.”

“Who orders you then?”

The flesh made a motion that Douglass interpreted as a shrug, or maybe just more responses
to the obvious pain it was in. It was difficult to tell. “Various citizens in the towers, following
orders to write those orders by orders made by other citizens. This Dagataar exists because
he needs to in order for hierarchy to be maintained.”

“But then who calls the shots?” Douglass stood up again. “Who do I need to report to for my
orders to be complete? Can anyone tell me who I report to so I can finish my damn orders?”

“Do you not understand it already? There is no final say. The system perpetuates itself. Sure,
at one point an individual or two set this all up and they are likely the “true” Dagataar. They
have all but faded into intentional obscurity, likely enjoying life in a private home somewhere
on Phaneron waiting for their faction to succeed. They let their system fully take control. I am
but a false god.”

“Okay, so I will report to you. Good enough. I don’t know what to do with all of that, I’m just a
laborer. Why tell me all of this instead of just giving me my orders?”
A rumbling came from the creature, followed by bile spewing out of the four orifices on its
head. Once they cleared, it spoke once more. “It was necessary so you could understand
your orders properly. My position is… taxing on the body. And you know how short of
lifespans natural bees have; these mechanical ones are hardly an improvement. To put
simply, I am looking for my replacement. I have heard you are quite the healthy and strong
individual. With few familial or influential ties too. How fortunate you can contribute to
Dagataar’s light in such a personal way.”

Douglass stepped back. “No, I don’t, I will not do that”

“You fool, as if we ever have a choice?”

Douglass ran to the door and pulled. The entrance locked shut.
