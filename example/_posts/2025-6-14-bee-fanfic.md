The following excerpt is written in Draconic in barely legible cursive with the occasional egg biscuit crumbs on the pages. The paper is crumpled with the faint smell of deer meat from
being stashed in Luiza’s bag. The title is smeared with deer blood, but you can make out the
word “Truth” in it.

--------------------------------------------------

“Go to the center-most tower and present your orders. Dagataar will be waiting for you.”

Douglass mentally repeated the words of the orders to himself over and over again, unable to
process. The orders felt lighter than they should be in his palms, becoming slick with his
anxious perspiration as the Seat of Stability grew larger in the distance. Each step through the
concrete jungle toward the looming capital building felt more and more weighted, as if its
sheer presence were pushing him back. Why him? Why now? Surely there were more worthy
followers to bathe in the presence of God.

Average in most aspects of his life, before being brought to Phaneron Douglass worked for
his father’s contractor business. Lacking the finesse or knowledge of the other workers, he
prioritized hauling the lumber and other materials around while his father and the other
employees focused on the actual construction work. It paid little but it gave Douglass
something to do. The efficient Dagataarian society pinpointed where his skills lied as they do
for everyone, and his life in the city mirrored his life before to the point he barely recognized
the change.

Like most of his orders, his last ones before receiving the summons involved carrying
particularly heavy goods from the docks to their destination. These items were usually shaped
in such a way that more standard machinery or carts would struggle to carry it properly, at
least until a new mechanism came out for said item. The muscle, pack mule, cart. These were
all nicknames that Douglass was used to, some he liked more than others. In both worlds he
was rarely valued for traits beyond his physical prowess and specifically for his raw strength
and health; Douglass was not trained in physical combat. Average in most other aspects of
his life, he could not help but wonder if there was a mistake. Surely there was someone else
more competent to handle whatever task Dagataar expected out of him.

In this particular case, the orders had him carrying a large spider-esque mass of what he
could only describe as steel and glass cables. He had no idea what it did other than the fact it
had the label “OM-?” on it followed by a schematic Douglass was not trained to read; it didn’t
take a genius to assume the OM stood for Ocean Machine. Why were those within Bastille
Agalloch if they were machines meant for the ocean anyways? But he was not given orders to
think, he was ordered to haul. And haul he did, using his bare hands as the thick calluses
covering the entire palms worked just as well as gloves in terms of protection from sharp
edges.

When he finished the job and received the orders to visit Dagatar, Douglass made no attempt
to hide his shock. Jonas, a particularly nosy character noticing his discontent, pried and made
the joyous news known to the rest of the staff immediately. Dock workers were congratulating
him, but he felt nothing. Numbness seeped into his core, and he only began to feel once more
when the cold metal of the orders were placed back into his hand, a faint vibration from the
bee inside stirring his senses.

“I...get to meet Datagaar?” he finally sputtered out. “But, why?”
Jonas shrugged. “Who knows? We ain’t gods. You got it good!” he slapped him on the back.

“But it doesn’t make sense-”

“It ain’t our jobs to know why, but do,” Jonas said firmly, chewing on a sausage biscuit. “You
know that well. May Dagataar’s light shine upon you.”

Douglass had no argument with that. Surely his lack of knowledge would be something they
kept in mind, and his questioning may even put the job at risk. He nodded and attempted to
keep his head a clean slate, but as the tower came closer in sight the anxiety rooted itself
deep into his core.

Finally, the entrance came into view for the Seat of Stability, the same building he brought the
OM part earlier to. Why did they have me receive my next orders all the way from the dock if
they wanted me to return here?, Douglass suddenly thought, the absurdity of it hitting him
before he pushed it away. Do not think, it’s not your job. Dagataar is a god, who knows what
goes on in a deity’s head.

As he walked though the main entrance, Douglass was greeted by rows and rows of
employees in teller boxes. Seeing their attire made him feel immediately out of place with his
rugged clothes built for longevity rather than professionalism. He walked past them straight to
the gate guarded by the Giant and presented his orders. The giant mostly ignored him, but his
associate was practically groveling and babbling at Douglass so quickly that he became
uncomfortable. Something about how he should tell Dagataar about his excellent work?
Douglass never liked suck-ups so he nodded with zero intention of doing what he asked, and
followed him to the elevator.

The elevators were a blur. At one point he had to leave the elevator, only to enter another
one. Yet another pang of doubt hit him, a god focused purely on efficiency made a clearly
inefficient choice. But yet again he pushed it down, though not as successfully as the last
time. The second elevator ride he was completely alone, and no one was there to greet him
when the doors finally opened. Slowly, hesitantly, Douglass left the elevators and walked up
the stairs to what was surely the top level.
