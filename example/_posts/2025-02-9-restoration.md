description: A series of explanations and events

The elven woman woke in the morning. Having recovered a bit overnight, she was able to explain to us a bit more of her situation. She has credited the shackles in being a means of turning herself and her brother into weapons. Considering the state she was in last night, she asked us to seek out her brother and free him from a similar affliction.

I'll refrain from writing most of her personal details, though I did want to make a note about a rose that grew out of her neck. Both she and her brother had these roses, and she claimed that removing it or damaging it may result in the death of the host. I didn't press her for details, but it seems this may have been a practice from her home plane.

While the rose was mystifying, Noggin and I felt confident in our abilities to deal with the shackles at least. Our small party headed out into the woods in pursuit of the brother.

We found the boy playing with the powers the shackle had given him. He'd grown increasingly irritable and distraught at his own inability to harness said powers. Physically, he was in much better shape than his sister on first glance. However, mentally, he seemed incorrigible.

Gremm was able to intervene and help talk him down. As the boy calmed, so did his erratic nature and abilities. Noggin and I had mainly kept our distance during the initial encounter, but after a while it seemed safe to approach and I made myself known. Gremm was able to talk the boy into working with us to get him some help, and was able to pass over a tranquilizer that the boy himself took.

From there, Noggin and I were able to make relatively short work out of removing his shackles. There was little difference between the sibling's shackles, but the brother's body was in far worse shape. Whereas the sister had been unconscious since our time of arrival, and had time to rest post-operation, the boy had seemly been conscious for quite some time and had been exposed to the effects of the shackles longer. It had taken a drastic toll on his body and had physically exhausted him to the point we feared deadly.

We healed him to the extent that he could be healed, and then worked to bring him back to the old church. His sister had mentioned to be adept at brewing potions, so it seemed a decent idea to reunite them.

The boy was reunited with his sister back at the church, and the sister thankfully was able to employ magic of her own to help her brother recover.

The spell she used, however, was one that I've brushed up against many times, but never truly understood. She considered it a lesser Restoration spell. I'd seen a greater Restoration spell once, but never a lesser one.

The sister was happy and willing to discuss the premise of the spell with me. I've included specifics in the spellbook portion of this journal, but I think a broad look at what the spell entails is good to write down as well.

Restoration spells are considered abjuration magic, and have a unique separation from most other healing spells.

If you can list all the common healing spells I've documented in this book, and start to write down overlapping traits, you'll be able to come up with a list that should seem similar to the following:

It seals skin/flesh abnormally fast
It repairs the flesh of damaged organs
It replenishes blood
It mimics a body's natural ability to heal
	
Now, Restoration magic does none of the above. Whereas healing magic can address the aftermath of a wound/disease/etc, a restorative spell actually addresses the problem at its root. I find this terribly confusing on name alone, but also terribly fascinating.

Up until this point, I've mostly been dealing with combat wounds. I could address the brother's visible wounds, but not the exhaustion that would have claimed his body.

The sister, rather than treating the physical wounds, treated the exhaustive disease. Her magic targeted the flesh only in the sense that it separated the body from the effect. The cause was not entirely external, but in treating it like an external entity, it could be isolated and then removed.

It's a difficult thing to unpack, but helps stitch together several lines of my research into this magic. I've read of cures to blindnesses, and counteracting poisons with magic, but I'd always assumed they were augmentations on healing spells. This is something else altogether used in a similar way, but cast in a completely different manner. It requires thinking of an ailment as a separate entity from the body, even if by scientific standards it is not.

And this is where my understanding of magic and science break down. I grew up believing that magic was simply a trick. It was the absence of understanding, but completely rooted in scientific values. Proper magic, as it exists in these realms, was also present in my realm, but we considered it an extension of the cheap magics we could disprove. Just because we did not understand how magic was performed, did not mean it violated any major principle of science.

These restoration spells, however, directly contradict this. From a medical standpoint, I understand what exhaustion is. I understand how the blanket condition of 'blinded' translates into tangible change within the body, and its core causes. Restoration does not care about my understanding, though. Restoration handles the condition in a way completely unpercieved to the scientific mind. It does not care about how the body works, or how a cause manifests within the flesh. It carves the symptom out and into its own reality, its own world where it is a physical thing that can be simply healed or removed from a person.

All this to say, I understand more about magic now than I did before. A magician's trick is not something to be explained away, nor something to be hand-waved. Magic has its own rules, and they aren't applicable to every spell and subset of domains. Some spells operate on their own logic, completely foreign to anything that I have learned prior, and to understand them you either must be lucky or find those who can wrap their heads around such strange machinations.

I'm grateful for having a foothold now into understanding this new branch of healing magic, but it also brings with it an exciting new concept: that there is far more to magic than even the master magicians of today understand. It is a slow, painful climb to understanding as I seek out such concepts, and I don't think highly enough of myself to promise a greater understanding of these things to others, but I can't help but wonder what sort of tricks one might learn by continuing to delve deeper into the minutia of impossible spells such as these. I wonder what other such impossibilities can be learned.
